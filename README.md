# To-Do
<p>Was working on a Big Project and realised my DOM manipulation super-powers receding.<br>
Well had to grab my Mjolnir and started this and a few other small projects as my practice for the Bigger one.<br><p>
# Plan
The main target was to complete 4 projects in 3 days.<br>
<strong>Good news Number 1:</strong> Today is only the 2nd day.<br>
<strong>Good news Number 2:</strong> This is the last project of the 4.<br><br><br>
# Future
<strong><em>Plan to add a Download as PDF button as well an option to edit the list name. (After I am done with Thanos).</em></strong>
<br>You can use it live at :<a href="https://todolist.tk/"> BRING ME THANOSSSSS</a>.
<br><small>Oh and if the custom domain expires her's another link ðŸ˜… : <a href="https://ashish-list.netlify.app/"> I went for the head</a></small>
