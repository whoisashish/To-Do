# To-Do
<p>Was working on a Big Project and realised my DOM manipulation super-powers receding.<br>
Well had to grab my Mjolnir and started this and a few other small projects as my practice for the Bigger one.<br><p>
<h2>The Plan</h2><br>
The main target was to complete 4 projects in 3 days.<br>
<strong>Good news Number 1:</strong> Today is only the 2nd day.<br>
<strong>Good news Number 2:</strong> This is the last project of the 4.<br><br><br>
# Future
